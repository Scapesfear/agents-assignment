## Overview

This repository contains a solution for the **LiveKit Intelligent Interruption Challenge**. The goal was to refine the conversational flow of a real-time AI agent by solving the issue of over-sensitive interruptions.

Previously, standard VAD (Voice Activity Detection) would cut off the agent if the user said passive listening cues like "Yeah", "Uh-huh", or "Okay". This solution implements a **Context-Aware Logic Layer** that distinguishes between **Passive Acknowledgement** (Backchanneling) and **Active Interruption**.

## Key Features

* **Smart Backchannel Filtering:** The agent continues speaking seamlessly if the user says filler words (e.g., "Yeah", "I see") while the agent is talking.
* **Semantic Interruption:** If the user mixes a backchannel with a command (e.g., "Yeah, wait a second"), the agent correctly interprets this as an interruption.
* **State Awareness:** The agent responds normally to "Yeah" or "Okay" if it is currently silent (treating it as a valid user turn).
* **Windows Compatibility:** Includes fixes for signal handling on Windows environments.
* **Modern Telemetry:** Updated OpenTelemetry implementation to support version 1.34+.

---

## How It Works (The Logic)

The solution is implemented via a "Greedy Phrase Consumption" algorithm injected into the agent's event loop. It operates on two specific checkpoints in `AgentActivity`:

### 1. The Algorithm (`nlp_utils.py`)
We moved away from simple keyword matching to a sequential token consumption approach to handle mixed inputs (Scenario 4).

1.  **Normalization:** The user's transcript is normalized (punctuation removed, lowercased).
2.  **Sorting:** The ignore list is sorted by length (longest phrases first) to prioritize specific phrases like "That makes sense" over generic words like "That".
3.  **Consumption:** The algorithm iteratively checks the start of the user's transcript against the allowed list.
    * If a match is found, that part of the transcript is "consumed" (removed).
    * This repeats until no matches are found at the start of the string.
4.  **Verdict:**
    * If the remaining string is **empty**, the input was purely backchanneling -> **IGNORE**.
    * If the remaining string contains **text** (e.g., "wait"), it contains a command -> **INTERRUPT**.

### 2. The Checkpoints (`agent_activity.py`)
The logic is applied in two places to ensure robustness against both VAD triggers and End-of-Utterance (EOU) triggers:

* **`_interrupt_by_audio_activity`:** This handles fast VAD interruptions. If the VAD triggers but the interim transcript is determined to be a backchannel, the interruption is **blocked**.
* **`on_end_of_turn`:** This handles the EOU model. If the user finishes speaking a backchannel word, the agent usually attempts to reply. We intercept this, return `True` (to clear the buffer), but **skip the reply generation**, allowing the agent to keep speaking.

### 3. State Awareness
All filtering logic is wrapped in a check: `if self._session.agent_state == "speaking"`.
* **If Agent is Speaking:** Filters are active (Backchanneling logic).
* **If Agent is Silent:** Filters are disabled. "Yeah" is treated as a valid answer/turn.

## Configuration

The list of ignored words and phrases is configurable in `livekit/agents/voice/agent_session.py`.

**Default Ignore List:**
```python
DEFAULT_IGNORE_WORDS = [
    # Single words
    "yes", "yeah", "ok", "okay", "hmm", "mhmm", "aha", "uh-huh", "yep", "yup", "sure", "cool",
    # Phrases (N-grams)
    "i see", "oh i see", "all right", "that's right", "makes sense", "that makes sense",
    "go on", "keep going", "got it", "fair enough"
]
```

To change this per agent, you can pass an `ignore_words` list when initializing the `AgentSession`.

### Test Scenarios & Results

| Scenario | User Input        | Agent State | Result      | Logic Applied                                   |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Long Explanation | "Yeah... uh-huh" | Speaking    | IGNORES     | Transcript consumed entirely.                  |
| 2. Passive Affirmation | "Yeah"           | Silent      | RESPONDS    | State check bypasses filter.                   |
| 3. Correction | "No stop"       | Speaking    | INTERRUPTS  | "No" and "stop" not in ignore list.            |
| 4. Mixed Input | "Yeah wait"     | Speaking    | INTERRUPTS  | "Yeah" consumed, "wait" remains.               |

The requirement for Python 3.9+ is standard for LiveKit agents, as modern asynchronous features used in the library rely on newer Python versions. Since your logs show you are using Python 3.11, listing "3.9+" is safe and accurate.

Here is the refined **Installation & Running** section. It explicitly warns users to install your local library instead of the public one.

-------

## Installation & Running

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.9+
* LiveKit Cloud Project (URL and API Key/Secret)

**Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agents-assignment

```


2. **Install Base Dependencies**
First, install the standard requirements.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


3. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Link Local Library**
To use the modified interruption logic, you **MUST** link your local version in editable mode.
```bash

pip install -e livekit-agents

```


4. **Update Telemetry**
Ensure modern OpenTelemetry packages are installed to match the updated code.
```bash
pip install "opentelemetry-api>=1.34" "opentelemetry-sdk>=1.34.1" "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp>=1.34.1"

```


5. **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file in the `\agents-assignment\examples\` directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_URL=
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
CARTESIA_API_KEY=
```


6. **Run the Agent**
```bash
python examples/voice_agents/basic_agent.py console

```

## 🔧 Modifications Summary

### 1. Core Logic
* **`livekit/agents/voice/nlp_utils.py`**: Created new utility file containing the `is_backchannel` consumption algorithm.
* **`livekit/agents/voice/agent_activity.py`**: Integrated `nlp_utils` into interruption handlers. Added specific logging to trace "BLOCKED" vs "ALLOWED" interruptions.

### 2. Infrastructure
* **`livekit/agents/voice/agent_session.py`**: Added `ignore_words` to `AgentSessionOptions` dataclass and initialization arguments to allow configuration.
* **`livekit/agents/ipc/supervised_proc.py`**: **Windows Fix.** Added a `try/except` block around `signal.signal` to prevent crashes when running in background threads on Windows.
* **`livekit/agents/telemetry/traces.py`**: **Telemetry Fix.** Updated imports to use `opentelemetry.logs` and `opentelemetry.sdk.logs` (stable API) instead of the deprecated `_logs` module, ensuring compatibility with modern dependencies.
